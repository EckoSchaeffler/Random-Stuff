## Emoting

Do not use emoting/posing to cheat to get around communication limitations.
Your master/mistress is not a telepath, so any emoting should be limited to actions and reactions, rather then inner thoughts.

## General Orders

- Always face your master/mistress, even if they are facing away from you.
- Always follow your master/mistress when they go somewhere and keep close by them, no matter if they have taken your leash or not. Unless you have gotten an order to stay put

### Following

When following your master/mistress it depends on the number of other ponies around how you are expected to follow and how to stand behind your master/mistress.
You WILL have to stay in easy groping distance to your master/mistress.

One Pony:\
		`P M`\
Two Ponies:\
		`P  `\
		`  M`\
		`P  `\
Three Ponies:\
		`P  `\
		`P M`\
		`P  `\
Four Ponies:\
		`P  `\
		`P  `\
		`  M`\
		`P  `\
		`P  `

## Body language

### Stomping

Stomping is one of the ways for communicating through body language.

- One Stomp: answer **Yes** to a question or order.
- Two Stomps: answer **No** to a question or order.
- Three Stomps: The answer to a question or order is neither **Yes** or **No**.
- Four Stomps: optional safeword

### Body language & RL

- If you need to go to the toilet, rub your legs together and make noises and then wait for permission to go to the toilet.
- If RL is intruding, face away from your master/mistress and kneel on the floor.
- if you are sleepy and need to go to bed, a pony can yawn.

## Punishment and Rewards

### Punishments

There are several stages of severity for punishments, though these can also be given arbitrary.

- Level 1: A harsh slap on the butt or breasts by either hand or crop. Alternatively a severe electroshock will be given by collar or belt.
- Level 2: Two to Five harsh slaps to the butt or breasts by either hand or crop, with each slap coinciding with a severe electroshock given by belt or collar.
- Level 3: It is assumed that the pony will not learn without further punishment and additional to Level 2 punishments, the collar AND belt are set to randomly give severe electroshocks for a time.
- Level 4: Similar to Level 3, but the randomly given electroshocks happen more often.
- Level 5: Similar to Level 4, but the electroshocks will be coming at an even higher frequency.
- Level 6: Pray you will not get Level 6.

### Rewards:

Rewards are given out by the master/mistress and do not follow any rules.
